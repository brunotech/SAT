"""" fact ""does not mean"" absolute certainty ""; moreover, there is no such animal in an exciting and complex world. the definitive evidence of logic and mathematics deductively flows from premises and gains certainty only because it is not the empirical world."" evolutionists make no claim to eternal truth, although creationists often do so (and then falsely argue for a fact), it can only be confirmed in such a way."
2,"experiments to find out if olive oil, soybean oil or coconut oil are saturated? the traditional method of measuring unsaturation is to measure the reaction between the substance and a solution of molecular brom. the br2 adds to the existing double bonds and you can measure the color change of the bromine solution. a less toxic (but more explosive) alternative is to hydrogenate the substance with a known amount of hydrogen gas and measure the change in pressure, volume or mass to determine how much hydrogen has been absorbed."
2,"The plane 27 + 4z = 5 meets the cone z ^ 2 = 4 (x ^ 2 + y ^ 2) in a curve.? the plane 27 + 4z = 5 meets the cone z ^ 2 = 4 (x ^ 2 + y ^ 2) in a curve. Use the method of the Lagrange multipliers to find the point on this curve that comes closest to the origin. You do not know why you need Lagrange multipliers for something simple. plane equation simplified to z = -11 / 2, which is a plane perpendicular to the z axis, intersection point at z = -11 / 2. As for the cone, choose any value of z, say 2. then 2 ² = 4 (x ² + y ²), i.e. x ² + y ² = 1, and this is a unit circle where each point on it has a z coordinate of 2, meaning that the plane of the circle is also perpendicular to the z axis."
2,"is the technology able to build them? at this point, non-tubular solar cells are being added to increase their efficiency eight-fold, hydrogen fuel cells are getting smaller, the japanese have built a permanent magnet hybrid electric motor that can drive a motorcycle 180 km on a single charge, and we have composites that are stronger and lighter than everything. there clearly seems to be the possibility that we have what it takes to build everything we need to get rid of the gas motors. we definitely have the technology, but there is more to take into account in its widespread use. we need to look at the political and economic impact that comes from not needing gas motors. i am sure taxpayers don't want to see an increase from now unemployed filling stations, gas truck drivers, refiners and drillers who get at least six months of unemployment audits. the technology doesn't need to be phased in so that... the system doesn't have to be shocked..."

He painted entire landscapes of tiny, individual dots. More than 100 years later, computer monitors follow the same principle. Everything on your monitor consists of thousands of small color dots known as pixels. the size in which text and graphics appear on your screen is determined by the number of pixels you select for your monitor, which is also known as resolution. Your monitor's resolution measures the number of pixels on your screen down - usually 640 x 480, 800 x 600, or 1024 x 76. If you choose a high resolution, the elements will appear smaller on your screen, but you will see a page below without scrolling."

But I realize that I'm not the strongest guy. Some of my classmates can't even do a single proper push-up, but they always hit me in an arm wrestle!! I started doing push-ups since I was in sixth grade, and now I'm in second grade, but why has my effort been wasted? I've spent two years practicing push-ups, but my classmates don't even try it. And yet some of them are stronger than me. Why is that? Arm wrestling takes different muscles and also involves physics (lever, size). We don't know your size or your muscles to strengthen those muscles, and lifting weights to work other muscle groups."

7,"what is the industry exposure ratio? to estimate covariance matrices, most analysts construct stock prices as a linear combination of factors. above way to do is factor analysis, in which one finds orthogonal factors that explain stock prices. then one can calculate the covariance between two stocks as covariance between factor portfolios. since portfolios are by definition less volatile than individual factors, covariance estimation is more stable. the disadvantage of this technique is that factors, with the exception of the first, are no simple explanation. some companies, especially barra, have developed methods to construct stock returns as linear combinations of non-orthogonal but easily identifiable factors. one type of such factors is industrial exposure: how much of a stock return is explained by an industry index? for more information, I recommend you read the factors analysis and basic financial factors that explain the statistical component of the industry exposure ratio."

7,"Work / Employment? why is it when you submit your dismissal to your employer that they get cocky with you? is it better in the future not to give up a dismissal? I have given up a few jobs on bad terms and am determined to leave them on good terms, but as they get closer to my departure date, they tend to become less flexible and write me down for stupid little problems that were simply not an issue before? Is there any reason for this? You should always perceive it. going to bad terms is a nightmare for both you and your employer. If you give and work, you will find that you are more likely to get a better reference, which is always handy. a good employer should not get capricious when you leave. They may have invested time and money in you, but you have done the same thing by working hard, etc., if someone should find an employer that you are personally happy that you will do bigger and brighter things. In an ideal world, they might try to get you to stay with a promotion, if you are satisfied with a job that you have more responsibility, or if your co-workers are more satisfied with being fair or have a job?"

9,"How are children supposed to deal with divorce? is it harder for children or adults? It's obviously hard for everyone involved, but it can really be more tragic for children, especially as there are so many things going on that they don't fully understand. Their world is turned upside down; if there is shared custody, their schools, homes and pretty much everything else in their lives will change dramatically. they often blame themselves for the departure of mom or dad and they feel divided over loyalties to their parents (mom hates dad, but I love dad, but mom hates me too?). and the stress that parents experience can also affect the way they treat their children.

Sometimes, divorce is the best option for a family, as in the end everyone will be better off."

9,"new relationship, he's 40, i'm 35, we're both divorced with children. we met on myspace. we met in person 2 with the woman on myspace who sends him dirty photos that he deletes in front of me. he doesn't have a phone at the moment, doesn't go online so we can chat. i only see him on weekends. i wonder what takes up all his time after he's off work at 4pm every day. he says he goes home, gets his dinner, then goes to sleep... i'm not there and I'm worried about that myspace chick that's following him. he has her on his list of friends on myspace as # 1 and she has him as # 1... what should i do? sorry for the joke earlier jenn, i assumed you were one of those kids who prevail on y! a. i don't know if you either need to find out more about him and get to know him better overall, or you'll have to move on the phone once, if he really doesn't have a second one for you."

10,"If this is the case and there are records of these things, it is possible that you are not eligible for military service. Previously used drugs and bipolar disorder and bipolar disorder, not the scars. - First of all, is there a record of drug use? if not, the only way they will find out is if you tell them. If you have had treatment for it, it is unlikely that they will find the records. If you are destroyed you will be tested for drugs. if you are tested positive after you are in it, you will be treated like a criminal and dismissed with a bad record. So don't go there - bipolar disorder will exclude you from military service if it leads to a permanent 3 profile or if you know about it before you sign up. You could get in without their knowledge, without this problem manifesting itself while you are on active duty, you will be evaluated for continued activity. Probably, you will have a medical problem before you will face this physical assessment and then deal with your situation."

10,"how do you recruit an airman (e-1) directly from basic training to 2nd lt? this actually happened when bush's father pulled the strings to get his son into flight school. what's wrong with this picture? what's wrong with having an aristocracy that can bend rules that the lower classes can't earn their jobs for other officers by going to an academy, doing a rotation or an ot. there's no evidence that bush did any of these things. here in africa it's different immediately after a military coup, you could just be rewarded with a rank after taking part."
10,"what about the future of Iraq? it will become the 51st state, the name will be changed to bushland to honor the man who liberated it from tyranny, the oil companies will be favored by the laws and decisions of the freely elected government who happened to run against his own parties. i can't think of anything else. maybe after our departure and the start of the civil war they will be led by a dictator and become a powerful nuclear country."
10,"How are tariffs imposed? and what are the more pros and cons of tariffs? I understand what a tariff is, but how is it implemented? Why is it implemented? What is it really doing to help economies? What else should I know / understand to write a paper on the pros and cons of tariffs on trade? Thank you, customs is, as you know, a tax on imported goods from other countries. Governments impose tariffs to discourage other countries from selling their goods here. How does this affect our economy? Net exports from us (a factor contributing to the nation's prosperity, so the higher the net exports, the better for our economy) correspond to exports from us minus imports. The tariffs reduce imports and therefore increase net exports, making us more prosperous. This is also good for another reason, because exports are rising and imports are falling, as other countries need the dollar to give us an advantage before buying goods."

10,"I'm 17, but believe it or not, I have an idea of what I'm putting into it. I have the will to act according to what I think is right and against what I think is wrong. If I don't think two nations are wrong, then I don't want to be a part of it. I also have a few friends who want to connect with me, sad as it sounds, I feel ready for it. I have the will to act according to what I think is right and against what I think is wrong. If I have liberated two nations, then I don't want to be a part of it. plus, I have a few friends who want to connect with me so that we can stand together and watch each other."

10,How do I report social abuse in the state of Vermont.. and disability abuse!!!!!? My neighbors stay home and drink... drugs... and.. on disillusionment... which is a farce... their backs are better than mine... and I go to work every day.. only the difference is that I like to work and get satisfaction for everything I earn... they get their paycheck by mail and just get more and more kids to get more money...

10,"Republican campaign-focused issue list 5? it's going to make America much better because # 1 - they = hate john kerry # 2 - they think john kerry is evil # 3 - it could be Bill Clinton's fault # 4 - possibly Michael j fox's fault # 5 - basically blame all demos and liberals for everything they didn't already think, so basically this is the right-wing leadership's well thought out plan - blame others, what?? funny how Rove, Bush, tony snow (or their children) never served the country in uniform - so what does that mean for our troops? these guys are certainly in touch with the middle class...? what the...?"
10,"why do the left hate george w bush and dick chaney so much? jealousy? ""who would lie!!!"" obviously everyone who would have supported kerry, gore or clinton, why do they hate bush and the government? that's actually very simple. the dems have gone so far to the left. they have turned back into the hippies of the 60s. the hippies were against everything to do with suppressing the needs of the individual. they were against any notion of war or defense, no matter what reasons. those who are more likely to be criminals (which party do you think supports most drug users and criminals?) will be against those who advocate strict laws and prosecution. religious ideals scare more likely to frighten the hippies than that any law or government deriving from these ideals will logically assess the situation and not suppress these ideals, which is a threat to the leftists. those who continue to focus on the prejudiced logistics rather than to actually explain the facts to them."
10,"How do you wage a global war on terrorism when...? we can't stop the terrorists (gang members) on the streets of our big cities? that's an honest question. And why did the American public allow this? I think the best step would have been: 1. to tell the world that we will equip anyone who harbors terrorists according to our motto with nuclear weapons. 2. we will cut off economic aid from anyone who helped with 911. 3. we will send federal task forces to deal with domestic terror (gangs). (the last one would be great for training in urban warfare) check it out, mate... ever heard of a small place called ulster / Northern Ireland when the last terrorist incident took place.... mmmmmmmmm. maybe there is a solution... jipeeeeeee."
