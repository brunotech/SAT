4,"what is the definition of smallholder agriculture in context with the african continent?   in an age of globalization and transnationalism, broad economic, political, and social forces are pushing societies towards homogenization on the model of the west and north. in the west and north itself, globalization is widely seen as unwelcome americanization. some observers contend that these global processes have marginalized nation-states.  others have noted how local societies, social groups, and even individuals throughout the world have tenaciously resisted these pressures. the phrase “the local and the global” has appeared in recent years as a trope for these contested interpretations of global trends in the programs of disciplinary conferences in the humanities and social sciences, and at area studies meetings. the terms globalization and transnationalism have been so often used and so frequently reinterpreted as to border on cliché. the occasion of a joint annual meeting of the african studies association (asa) and the canadian association of african studies/association canadienne des études africaines (caas/acea) in new orleans provides an appropriate context and venue to take analysis of these contested processes one step further by looking at three of the major arenas of contestation: identity, language, and memory. hence the annual meeting invites papers and panels that deal with these issues in africa and the diaspora today and in the past.   in recent years, cultural studies in africa have privileged the study of memory and identity—and by implication, language—in efforts to understand the renewal of civil society, and the horrendous outbreaks of inter-ethnic, civil, and military violence on the continent. efforts at healing the hostility between ethnic and racial groups, such as thetruth and reconciliation commission in south africa and the local and regional truth commissions in burundi, have also stimulated much thought about the creation, re-creation, and maintenance of national communities. political studies—which traditionally eschewed examination of these topics as the stuff of humanities or  “soft” social science—have of late also begun to acknowledge the importance of identity politics and popular memory in analyses of contemporary african politics, and more notably, in studies of democracy, revolution, and genocide. it is abundantly clear, for example, that understanding identity politics in côte d’ivoire is essential to comprehending the conflict between ivoirians of coastal origin and those whose forefathers and foremothers came from burkina faso, mali, and other regions of the west african interior in the twentieth centutry.  and well before that, mobutu’s use of the language of « authenticité, » which was invoked by politicians elsewhere on the continent, served to legitimize his government as a nationalist rather than a neo-colonial regime.   historical studies in africa have for a long time directed attention to the roles of language (and shared culture) in the development of community and difference—whether it be the sense of a “mande world” among speakers of the mande languages, or the consolidation of new “worlds” with the spread of languages such as swahili, hausa, arabic, mossi, and lingala among peoples and groups across significant stretches of the continent. more recently, africanist historians have taken a page from the french scholar nora to explore the significance of “lieux de mémoire,” or “places of memory,” to understand how contemporary understandings of sites of purported historical significance for groups and societies (and countries) affect interpretations of the past, as well as how they sometimes act as touchstones for the revival of past identities or the coalescence of new ones. obviously identities change through time. a new awareness of the popular use of history has also made it apparent that ordinary people order and identify with historical experiences and events in ways quite different from the ways that professional h","what is the definition of smallholder agriculture in context with the african continent?
